&lt;h2 id="1-traces-and-spans-explained">1. Traces and Spans explained&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A trace is a collection of spans that share the same trace ID, representing a unique transaction handled by your application and its constituent services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../images/trace-spans.png" alt="Traces and Spans">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each span has a name, representing the operation captured by this span, and a service name, representing within which service the operation took place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, spans may reference another span as their parent, defining the relationships between the operations captured in the trace that were performed to process that transaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each span contains a lot of information about the method, operation, or block of code that it captures, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the operation name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the start time of the operation with microsecond precision&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how long the operation took to execute, also with microsecond precision&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the logical name of the service on which the operation took place&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the IP address of the service instance on which the operation took place&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
